[DEFAULT]

# Jaeggi-style interface with default scoring model? 
# Choose either this option or JAEGGI_MODE but not both.
# This mode allows access to Manual mode, the extra sound sets, and the
# additional game modes of Brain Workshop while presenting the game in
# the more challenging Jaeggi-style interface featured in the original study.
# With the default BW scoring model, the visual and auditory sequences are
# more randomized and unpredictable than they are in Jaeggi mode.
# The only effect of this option is to set the following options:
#   ANIMATE_SQUARES = False, OLD_STYLE_SQUARES = True,
#   OLD_STYLE_SHARP_CORNERS = True, SHOW_FEEDBACK = False,
#   GRIDLINES = False, CROSSHAIRS = True, BLACK_BACKGROUND = True,
#   WINDOW_FULLSCREEN = True, HIDE_TEXT = True, FIELD_EXPAND = True
# Default: False

# Jaeggi mode?
# Choose either this option or JAEGGI_INTERFACE_DEFAULT_SCORING but not both.
# This mode emulates the scoring model used in the original study protocol.
# It counts non-matches with no inputs as correct (instead of ignoring them).
# It also forces 4 visual matches, 4 auditory matches, and 2 simultaneous
# matches per session, resulting in less randomized and more predictable
# sequences than in the default BW scoring model.
# Different thresholds are used to reflect the modified scoring system.
# Access to Manual mode, additional game modes and sound sets is disabled 
# in Jaeggi mode.
# Default: False
